# text_analysis  
In this section of the course, we have barely scratched the surface of the complex field of text analysis. While working on this text analysis assignment, consider some of the basic points discussed in class.  
Organization of text in documents enables document analysis. However, the organization may also be a constraint. Silge and Robinson's Text Mining with R demonstrates various document analysis methods based on single-word tokenization. The results are impressive, considering that single-word tokenization ignores sentences, paragraphs, headings, and other document features authors use to communicate clearly through documents.  
The Truenumbers package offers an alternative approach to organizing document text, tokenizing sentences and paragraphs. Simply retaining paragraph and sentence boundary information extends the analytic possibilities, but Truenumbers offers other features to track, group and subset data items. Using the tagging feature of Truenumbers provides a way to track theme-related terms and mark passages where action, emotional responses, or other key events occur. New Truenumbers can be made to record statistics and other derived measures.
